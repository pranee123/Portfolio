## About Me

I completed a Post Graduate Program in Data Science and Engineering from Great Learning in 2024. During this course, I gained hands-on experience with various tools for data cleaning, building machine learning models, and understanding the workings of Artificial Intelligence (AI). 

Before this, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Nalla Malla Reddy Engineering College, affiliated with JNTUH, in 2022.

I have 20 months of experience as a US Recruiter, where I developed strong analytical and client management skills. This role involved handling large datasets of candidate information, tracking performance metrics, and optimizing recruitment processes through data trend analysis.

## Skills

- **Programming Languages:** Python, SQL
- **Data Visualization:** Tableau
- **Machine Learning:** Predictive modeling, Natural Language Processing
- **Tools & Technologies:** Generative AI, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering

## Projects

### Twitter Sentiment Analysis
![Twitter Sentiment Analysis](images/Twitter.jpg)
In this project, we analyze tweets to determine the sentiment or emotions expressed by users, categorized as positive, negative, or neutral. We use Twitter's API to collect data, preprocess the text, and apply NLP techniques. Machine learning models such as Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression classify the sentiment.

### Image to Text Generator
![Image to Text Generator](images/Image to text.png)
In this project, we generate detailed captions for images using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base and use a generative model to create contextually accurate descriptions.
